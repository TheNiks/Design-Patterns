# Design-Patterns

In a codebase today, numerous design patterns are used, thus we tried to grasp one of them, called "Composite."
Introduction
One of the well-known structural design patterns is the composite. It creates objects using a single interface. It extensively uses polymorphism and a tree structure made up of discrete nodes or tiny components that all have a common interface. We can simply construct a more sophisticated structure out of little components.

A pluggable design pattern also includes composite patterns.
